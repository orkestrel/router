// ============================================================================
//  The core matching engine + fetch dispatcher — type definitions (the §5
//  source of truth). `Router` is a PURE, environment-agnostic registry-and-
//  match engine: it compiles route path patterns, extracts URL-decoded params,
//  ranks candidates by specificity, and exposes the `answers` predicate as the
//  single seam both the browser `Navigator` and the core `Dispatcher` compose
//  differently. `Dispatcher` layers fetch-standard, method-dimensioned dispatch
//  on top of one `Router<RouteRecord<TState>>`. Neither entity touches DOM or
//  `node:*` — only `URL` / `Request` / `Response` / `AbortSignal`, universal
//  web-standard globals available in every runtime this package targets.
//
//  Type groups, all `readonly` per AGENTS §11:
//
//    1. Path grammar typing — {@link PathParams}, the template-literal param
//       extraction that gives handlers a typed `context.params`.
//    2. The registry value types — {@link RouteEntry}, {@link RouterMatch},
//       {@link RouterAnswers}, {@link CompiledPath} — plain data, no behavior.
//    3. The registry entity surface — {@link RouterInterface} / {@link GroupInterface}
//       / {@link RouterOptions}, the shared `Router` both faces compose.
//    4. The dispatch surface — {@link Method}, {@link RouteContext},
//       {@link RouteHandler}, {@link RouteInput}, {@link RouteRecord},
//       {@link DispatchResult}, {@link DispatcherEventMap},
//       {@link DispatcherOptions}, {@link DispatcherInterface},
//       {@link DispatchGroupInterface} — the fetch-standard dispatch entity.
//
//  `EmitterHooks` / `EmitterErrorHandler` / `EmitterInterface` are imported as
